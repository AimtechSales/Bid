Hello, Hope you are doing well. 

I can help you convert figma to Html and will assist you with the finest development services. 

Firstly, could you please share the Figma file or specific details about the design you'd like to convert?
This will help me understand the layout, styling, and any interactive elements that need to be incorporated into the HTML.

Best Regards 
Ahmed.
